        <p>Hello there, all the cat lovers. 
            My name is Crush and I am an orange and white, cute fluffy boy.
            Below, you can see 6 of my favorite pictures of all times.
        </p>

            <img src="./images/img-1.jpg" alt="An orange cat laying on the floor."/>
            <div class="text">
                This is my first favorite picture. 
                My mom took it when we lived in the apartment 
                (God, I miss that place sometimes, or do I?).

            <div class="text">
                I love this picture of me (I mean ... who wouldn't?). 
                This is picture was taken in our brand new home. 
                Sunbathing is one of my favorite funs. I swear!

            <div class="text">
                I look insanely beautiful in this pic. 
                My eyes and my facial expression are just "WOW".

            <img src="./images/img-4.jpg" alt="An orange cat showing a blep."/>
            <div class="text">
                Here's me blepping so hard. 
                I guess I was having a good time.

        <div class="photo">
            <img src="./images/img-5.jpg" alt="An orange cat in a cardboard box."/>
            <div class="text">
                If you know me, then you know that I just love cardboard 
                boxes and if I fits I sits.

        <div class="photo">   
            <img src="./images/img-6.jpg" alt="An orange cat sleeping on the carpet with a large blep."/>
            <div class="text">
                I saved one of the best for the last. Any time I have a blep it just means "good time, happy kitty". 
                I love this picture so much but I love sleeping even more.
